### Seeking for a new job
I am going to be laid off at the end of 2024.

Seeking for a DevOps or Test Development Engineer job.


### About Me
I started my career in UI automation testing development and have transitioned into DevOps. 

Although my work has always been based on Python and focused on efficiency development, my technical stack is broad but not deep. 

In the future, I plan to delve deeper into the DevOps field, focusing on cloud-native ecosystems and virtualization implementations, while also exploring the principles behind UI automation.
